\section{Structure}
This project followed a waterfall based approach where each smaller element in the process was done iteratively. The waterfall based approach suited this project since each phase had to be completely finished before moving on to the next part. Each one of these phases, on the other hand, followed a more iterative agile process. One example is the development part of the project, this phase could not start until the high-fi was completely done and tested. Two of the phases where done iteratively, on the other hand (see \ref{fig:phases}).

The phases that can be seen in the figure \ref{fig:phases}, represents the different steps of the work process. Each new phase was dependent on the results of the last phase and at the end of each phase what was needed to be done and used in the next phase was decided. Since each phase can be seen as a smaller project they are all divided into a separate chapter in this thesis. Each chapter explains the work process during the phase. If relevant, results for that phase is explained.  Lastly, once again if necessary for the phase, results where analysed and changes will be described in the chapter.
\\\\
Following the phase chapters, results of the actual test are shown in the "Results" chapter, this includes numbers, graphs and calculations done etc. These results are then discussed in the following chapter "Discussion". In the "Conclusion" chapter i will explain my conclusion, what limitations exist and future research necessary.
