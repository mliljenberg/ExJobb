The goal of the Investigation phase is to gain a deeper understanding of the differences between Chinese and western websites. Then using this information we will decide on what features we want to analyse and what usability metrics we want to use for this.
\section{Method}
Firstly, several Chinese websites and their western counterparts were identified and the main differences that had to do with the project scope were analysed. Secondly, a conclusion where what design patterns that will to be tested was selected. The metrics used to measure these design differences was also decided.

\section{Results}
\section{Chinese vs Western websites comparison}
Chinese websites are clearly very different in design compared to their western counterparts. The differences are more that just the look and feel of the sites but also the UX design of the sites are very different. We will look at some of Chinas biggest and most popular websites and in some cases compare them to the English counterparts. 

\subsection{QQ}
QQ is one of the top most visited website in China (see fig \ref{fig:QQ.com}). \cite{top_sites_china} \cite{top_sites_alexa} QQ like many other Chinese websites does not focus on one thing but has many different functions. Part of the functionality that QQ offer is: instant messaging, online social games, music, shopping, microblogging, news, movies, group and voice chat software etc. Going to the main homepage (QQ.com) you will be greeted by their news page. As we can see this page is quite information dense. If we count all the clickable elements without hovering over anything on a standard computer screen we get about 147 clickable elements . If we compare this to BBC's homepage \cite{bbc} which is considered fairly information dense by western standards.  It has 48 clickable elements on its homepage. This means that with only counting clickable elements QQ is over 3 times more information dense than BBC.

One element that is quite common on Chinese websites that we can see in QQ as well is it's menu bar (see fig \ref{fig:QQ_menubar}). This menu bar has two rows with a total of 40 options. This type of menu bar is quite common and can be seen at many other Chinese sites.

\subsection{BBC}

\subsection{Taobao and Ebay}
Taobao is one of the biggest websites in the world. Taobao is similar to the American Ebay in terms of what the website provide. They both are online shopping websites where you can buy almost everything you need. The design and user-experience focus on the sites are quite different. Ebay has a very sleek design with darker colors and only 20 clickable elements (see fig:\ref{fig:ebay}). Ebay also have expanding menu bar that contains about 6-10 clickable elements (see fig:\ref{fig:ebay_menu}).

\end{figure}

If we look at the Chinese version Taobao we once again can clearly tell the difference in information density (see fig:\ref{fig:taobao}). The main page has about 49 clickable elements. And the menu items on the right hand side can expand and show between 55-80 clickable links and elements (see fig:\ref{fig:taobao_menu}). That is about 8 times more clickable elements compared to Ebay. Another thing to take notice on Taobao is the strong colors, Taobao frequently use very strong red, purple, orange and blue. Ebay keeps more to gray and let their products provide the stronger colors to make you focus on them.

\subsection{Analyses of Ctrip}
Many Chinese web sites change quite a lot when changing language. Ctrip is one of these sites. Ctrip is a very common travel site in China which allows you to book hotels, flights, car rental etc. When you select to translate this site to English it does not only translate the site but the whole layout and design of the website change as well (see  fig: \ref{fig:ctrip_chinese} for Chinese version and fig: \ref{fig:ctrip_english} for English version). Except for the brand and name of the website you can barely tell that it is the same site.

\label{fig:ctrip_english}
\end{figure}
 The main difference we can see between these sites is the density of content. The Chinese version has a lot more content on a smaller area. Counting clickable elements without hovering over anything we can find 40 clickable elements on the Chinese version compared to 26 clickable elements on the English version. When using the Chinese site all links open a separate window instead of a second menu or tab. This is a quite common phenomena found in many sites.

 \section{Conclusion Phase 1}
 \subsection{Common Chinese design that differs from western design}
Looking through the websites we can identify several design features (outside of the language differences) that differ in Chinese and western websites. 
\\\\
These are:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item High information density
 \item Colors
 \item Ad content
 \item Navigation
 \end{itemize}
 
 The main factor we could see across all websites is the difference in information density. Chinese websites have significantly higher information density compared to their western counterparts. This is one feature we want to examine more closely in our later study. Colors and navigation will be explored but not prioritized. These will be included to give a more accurate feel of the site instead of focused on. Chinese sites have a higher ad content than many of the western counterparts, this is a feature that not will be looked into in this study.   There are several hypothesis for why Chinese sites are so information dense. Some of these hypothesis are: cultural/trends, historical, holistic vs analytic perceptions (ref or cite..) and language. Because of limitations with understanding of the Chinese language, history and culture we will mainly examine trends and perception.
 \\\\
  To do this we will create two interfaces, one western inspired and one with inspiration from Chinese designs. To make sure that the interfaces will look Chinese and Western we will with the help from professional UX-designers from Sweden and China develop some prototypes. The prototypes will then be tested on both users with Swedish and Chinese heritage respectively. We will later develop a working interface from these prototypes that will be able to measure what the users do in response to certain tasks. Main measurements that will be used are task-success, time-on-task and System usability scale. \cite{brooke1996sus} 
  \\\\
  Four interfaces will be created, two with western design and two with a Chinese design. The first interface will take inspiration from the news sites QQ and BBC homepages. The goal with these interfaces will be to test how well the users can find materials in highly image and text cluttered interfaces. Both interfaces will have about the same amount of material and clickable elements, the main difference will be that the western site will be longer which forces the user to scroll down on the page and some of the information will be mapped in sub-menus using natural mapping. \cite{Norman} The Chinese inspired site will provide most of the material on the screen directly for the user to see without any nested menus.  The other two interfaces will use more advanced material. In these two sites the users will have to analyse and click on graphs to complete tasks, here we will also have a more cluttered Chinese inspired site and one western inspired. The goal with these is to also the check how well the users can understand and deal with information density. The reason for having this website as well is to check how the two groups can perform on non text based material, I.e does visual material that requires the user to analyse pictures and patterns change how much information the user can handle? Having a separate interface will also allow us to gather more data to minimize the risk of abnormalities from testing one site will influence the data to much.
  \\\\
  Chosing the ux questions:
  In \cite{Holistic_vs_Analytic} has shown that perception differs in western and eastern cultures. \cite{cross_web} further proves that this is true in the case of people observing websites where users with analytic perception follows the F-shaped pattern \cite{pernice2014people}. Holistic people on the other hand does not follow the F-shaped pattern when browsing through a website. \cite{cross_web} One Interesting aspect to look into is how this affect performance when looking for specific elements. To do this we will select elements both in accordance to the F-shaped pattern and elements outside of this pattern. By testing the performance on both analytical and holistic minded people we should hopefully get a indication if there is any difference and how well people follow the F-shaped pattern when looking for a specific element. The test will be unsupervised which means that we will have to get a larger test audience to get any significant results. To test this we will create test for the sites BBC and QQ where we will ask the test subject to find elements inside the F-shaped pattern range and also outside
  F-shaped pattern vs non F-shaped (\cite{cross_web})
  Information density
   
 \subsection{Limitations}
 Even if many of the biggest websites in china are quite information dense there are several websites that have adopted a sleeker look for their sites/services. Two big examples of this is the messenger application WeChat which is very big in china and the the Alipay service website. I will not focus on sites like this and there might be a trend in china that is moving towards a sleeker look. In this report i have specifically chosen the some of the most popular regularly used sites that differ from the western design standard. In the case of Taobao it might seem very difficult for many westerners to use but it is as of now one of the biggest websites in the world. There are also cases of websites more or less copying western websites because they are blocked in China. A typical example of this is youku and youtube, these types of sites will not be focused on in this report either.
