 \subsection{Emerging trends in china}
 The likability of the younger generation of chinese people also matches the emergin trend of simplistic designs on chinese mobile applications.
 \subsection{Reason for differences}
 \section{Limitations}
// FROM Investigation chapter
Although many of the well-known websites in China are quite information dense, several other websites that have adopted a sleeker look. Two big examples of this is the messenger application WeChat, a popular Chinese social media platform, and the the Alipay service website. We will not focus on these more modern sites as it is beyond the scope of this research. In this project, we specifically select the most popular regularly used sites that differ from the western design standard. In the case of Taobao, it might seem very difficult for westerners to navigate the site, but it is now one of the biggest websites in the world. There are also cases of websites more or less copying western websites because they are blocked in China. A typical example of this is Youku, which mimicked the American video sharing site, YouTube - these types of sites will not be investigated in this report either.
