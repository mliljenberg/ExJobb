The goal of this pilot study is to test if the layout will be able to give any significant results. Further, the pilot study will also test if the tasks in the study can answer our goal questions. The pilot study will also give a clearer indication of the potential limitations this study will have.
\section{Method}
The pilot study was done by showing the testing users the developed sketch prototype. Using this sketch prototype the tester sat next to the user and asked them to perform the tasks written down on a piece of paper (In Chinese for the Chinese users and in English for the Western users). First, the participants got a minute to look around the page to get a quick feel for the layout of the site. Then a question was shown to the user and a timer was started simultaneously. When the test subject found the requested image or text, they indicated that they had found the information and the timer was then stopped. If a user could not find a certain piece of information, they were allowed to skip that question. This was repeated until all the tasks were fulfilled.

\section{Results}
The users where asked to perform the following tasks:

\section{Discussion}
This pilot study revealed a lot of relevant issues. One main problem was that some of the news was repeated in several places of the site. This made some tasks irrelevant since the news could be located at several different locations. Additionally, some questions were badly translated as well. For example, the question of the sports coach seemed to confuse many of the Chinese users. Also, the questions regarding finding images on the qq site did not provide with any meaningful result since QQ has very few pictures and therefore they did not check how well the user performed in information-dense sites. Another thing that was noticed during the test was how the order of the tasks affected task success. All the users quickly found news closely located to the previous task. This needs to be kept in mind when designing the next set of questions.
\\\\
We can see the measurements from the study in \ref{fig:pilot_study_bbc} and \ref{fig:pilot_study_qq}. Since the goal of the pilot study was to try out if the concept for the real study works, we did not have enough participants for this data to have any statistical significance. As mentioned above, the goal of the study was to find problems with the questions, translation and user-experience. According to Norman(year) we only need about 5 participants to find the majority of user experience problems. However, if we want this survey to be statistically significant when actually measuring time differences we would need a larger amount of users.


\section{Conclusion}
Many questions will be changed to obtain better results for the projects, also both the sites will have the same structure for its tasks. Both sites will have 13 tasks to perform. Four of the tasks will be about the menu-bar, four of the tasks will be about finding precisely described news titles, one task will be about following the page on social media and lastly, 4 of the tasks will be about finding more general described news. About half of the tasks will be in the F-shaped pattern view sight. The other half of the questions will be located on the right-hand and central side of the website. Finally, the sites will be designed so the ad content of both sites will be adjusted to the language of the site (i.e BBC in Chinese will have Chinese ads and vice versa). 
\\\\
Some functionality will be added to the prototype such as giving feedback and also following on social media. This will be done according to standards as can be seen in \ref{Chapter4}. A menu with the option to give feedback and follow on social media will be added to the right hand side on the Chinese pages respectively on the bottom of the page for the western site.
