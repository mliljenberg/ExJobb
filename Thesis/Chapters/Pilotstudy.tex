The goal of this pilot study is to test if the hypnosis will have any chance of giving any significant results. The pilot study will also test if the tasks in the study actually answers what we want to find out. The pilot study will also give a clearer indication of the limitations of these tests.
\section{Method}
\subsection{Pilot study}
The pilot study was done by showing the test people the developed sketch prototype. Using this sketch prototype i sat next to the user and showed them what i asked them to do written down on a piece of paper (In chinese for the chinese people and in english for the western). First the people got a minute to look around the page to get a quick feel for the layout of the page. Then a question was showed to the user and a timer was started at the same time. When the test subject found the requested image or text they indicated that they had found the information and the timer was then stopped. This was repeated until all the tasks where fulfilled.

\section{Conclusion}

Pilot studie/ux studie med kineser:
the question angry sport coach did not seem to work well. I think it was badly formulated becuse people did not seem to understand what to look for. Some of the news did not test the F-shaped pattern correctly since they could be found on more than one place on the page (koeran and samsung heir questions). I have not looked thorugh the data yet but it seems like everyone might have about the same search pattern when looking for something specific. These people might also have been influensed by the western culture and this can affect the results.....

QQ: maby i should remove to easy questions regarding images, it seems like this does not test information density on qq since there actually are not that many images on the site.

The questions where also showed in a sequence that might affect the results... Many times the content was close to each other which led to some subjects finding the information quicker beacuse of this (maby this should be included in a more tested way... to actually test it).
